### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**mat2m10/mat2m10** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on translating my previous machine learning projects from MatLab to Jupyter.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to write a readme for my own profile.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning projects
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you want, but never about what happened in Amsterdam.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: matthieu.dehemptinne@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: Math
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am currently !sober
